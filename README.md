# Pomodoro

This repository holds a time management App that uses the Pomodoro technique. It is built with ```Typescript```, ```NextJS```, ```Bootstrap 5``` and ```Sass```.

Currently, pre-rendering with NextJS has been disabled temporarily because the App uses LocalStorage as the main datasource.
This will change in future releases.
